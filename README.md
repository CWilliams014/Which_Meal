 

# Which Meal

An app that will compare any number of your favorite meals from your favorite restaurants and determine which is healthiest for you

## -About-

Wouldn't it be nice if while you are sitting down at a restaurant, you could quickly find what on their menu is healthiest for you? Or when you're deciding where to eat, you could compare meals between your favorite restaurants and get a personalized answer to which of them is least likely to kill you? 

Thats the idea here...

 

##-Beta-

Need to get certified nutritionist input on the calculations

### Example:

Very easy to use right now:
* 1) Select a restaurant from the dropdown menu
* 2) Click a meal you want to eat
* 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 for any number of restaurants
* 4) Click Compare
* 5) Eat the healthier option and gain +1 days on Earth 



### TODO:
* Provide accounts for personalized restaurants
* Implement maps to find closest restaurant
* Expand the number of restaurants
* Add explanations of why the winning meal was chosen
* Create a variety of different modes like : Male/Female, Age, Body type, Time of day(very important in my opinion - what you eat for late night munchies at 3am will effect you the next day significantly)


* More cool stuff :)

### Stack 
Currently running node and with a redis database, react view with redux being implemented.


### What can you do?

Use it(cautiously for now), Clone it, fork it, npm install, you know the drill. Planning to build this out in the coming weeks if you'd like to help have at it.
